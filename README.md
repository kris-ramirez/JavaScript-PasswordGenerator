# JavaScript-Password-Generator


## Description

This weeks challenge was to create a random password generator using JavaScript. We were given the HTML and CSS code and a few lines of JavaScript to start. I built this project to showcase the skills we were learning in class to create a dynamic app that is also responsive. This app helps users create random passwords with the criteria they set. I learned about functions, the for loop, and the importance of tutoring in this challenge. I still struggle with some of the concepts around functions in JavaScript, but I am continuing to learn. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Use this function to create a random password with various criteria.

You will be prompted for the desired length of your password.

Then you will go through and choose the rest of the criteria for your password.

Finally your password would appear in the box above the Generate Password button.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
