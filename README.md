# JavaScript-Password-Generator


## Description

This weeks challenge was to create a random password generator using JavaScript. We were given the HTML and CSS code and a few lines of JavaScript to start. I built this project to showcase the skills we were learning in class to create a dynamic app that is also responsive. This app helps users create random passwords with the criteria they set. I learned about functions, the for loop, and the importance of tutoring in this challenge. I still struggle with some of the concepts around functions in JavaScript, but I am continuing to learn. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Use this function to create a random password with various criteria.
